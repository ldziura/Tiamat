# Tiamat

The idea behind the Tiamat project is to provide a simple, easy to use, and ergonomic gaming keyboard.
For the moment the project is in a very early stage, but it is already possible to use it.

| This is still a very early prototype and the files are in constant changes. It is best to use this repository as a reference instead of a ready to use project. |
